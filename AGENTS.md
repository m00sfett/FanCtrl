# AGENTS Instructions

- Keep code formatted with 4 spaces and follow PEP 8 style.
- Prefer modern type hints using built-in generics (e.g., `list[str]`).
- After modifying code, install dependencies with `pip install -e .` if needed and run `pytest -q`.
- When editing service files, use the `fanctrl` console script and avoid unnecessary settings like a working directory.
